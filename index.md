---

# About the Workshop

This workshop will explore how ontology-based LLM systems can enhance trust, autonomy, and accountability in AI agents. The goal is to examine the challenges, opportunities, and best practices for designing AI systems that interact safely with personal knowledge graphs.

---

## Motivation

AI agents are increasingly handling sensitive personal and organizational data. With the rise of agentic AI, it is crucial to ensure systems are trustworthy, ethically aligned, and accountable. This workshop aims to address the following:

- How AI can leverage ontologies for better reasoning.
- Ensuring autonomy and control over data for users.
- Designing systems that are accountable and transparent.
- Ethical and diverse perspectives in AI deployment.

## Discussion Points

1. **Trust**: How can ontology-driven AI systems engender trust in users?
2. **Autonomy**: How can users retain meaningful control over personal and organizational data?
3. **Accountability**: How can AI systems be held responsible for decisions and outputs?
4. **Ethical Diversity**: Ensuring ethical and unbiased AI reasoning across contexts.
